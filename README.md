This is the term project of the CmpE48A Cloud Computing course, instructed by Bahri Atay Özgövde at Boğaziçi University, carried out by [Ömer Şükrü Uyduran](https://github.com/Simurgan) and [Bengisu Kübra Takkin](https://github.com/Brunettow).

You can apply the configurations under the k8s folder to your GKE cluster for deploying the project. Don't forget to define your secrets properly before the deploy.
You can stress-test the system by running the Locust tests under the locust directory.
